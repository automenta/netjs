Netention for Node.JS
=====================

Netention is SEMANTIC GROUPWARE that automatically organizes a community of peoples' realities.

It can then interlink them with automatically discovered opportunities that are mutually inter-satisfying - essentially suggesting to its participants how they could realize the desired futures they have described.

Netention is a tool for describing one's current reality (“is”), and potential future realities (“should be”) – as linked data objects. A semantic description of a life (human, animal, plant, or otherwise) can be considered to consist of a set of data declarations representing aspects about which one is concerned or interested.  Now we can _link_ the current and desired states of the real and imaginary concepts in our minds - including people, environments, objects, processes, knowledge, or time.

Netention realizes one’s goals based on their desires and translates them into tangible outcomes in one’s own growable network.

It can be used to organize a community, a business, a family, or a government in similar ways because it is designed to consider how the mind expresses thought (especially language) at a neural level.

Netention aims to solve, in general, all resource management and planning issues that occur among communities of participants.  A complete system could conceivably eliminate the balkanization of various separate online services that presently serve relatively narrow subsets of the more general problem.

Netention is under development and is experimental.  Use at your own risk

The term Netention is a portmanteau of the words Network, and Attention or Intention.  It refers to a community's collective abilities.

Don't "search" - simply describe what you want to happen.  Edit it at any time later to adjust or improve the description.

Netention works at the thought level, to elicit descriptions of "something" that you're thinking about.  Whether it describes a dream (something that you would like to happen), an object, or hypothetical object - it can be fully described and re-described.  

A hypothetical (desired) object can become an actual object, or an abstract concept can become an actual future event, etc.  Imagine this transformational process as like when ice undergoes a state change from solid to liquid, thus providing more flexibility and expressivity and freedom to each water atom in the system.

The system can then connect your descriptions to others - these are analogous to hyperlinks in the [semantic web](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web‎), representing possibilities that one may choose.  Possibilities suggest ways to achieve the implied intended state of something, whether one is interested in:
* buying, selling, or trading something
* participating in a community
* curating knowledge
* etc...

Netention uses a variable-strength _tagging system_ for calculating approximate classification and correlation.  _Tags_ represent classes in a shared editable ontology.  Each tag may support zero or more _properties_ which provide a rich vocabulary of typed-metadata which one may add or remove from an object (within certain limitations).  Netention may prompt you for more data than you had originally considered, igniting creativity and improving thought clarity.

Netention is a system for describing _mental objects_: thoughts, places, concepts, times, etc... Create descriptions of reality that consist of data about the state in which something presently “is”, AND statements about your desired or anticipated state in which it “should be” - how you would like it to become - usually involving ranges of acceptable indeterminate values.

Using these two kinds of statements, the system can link any set of objects according to a presence of mutually satisfying statements, like a lock and key, or receptor site on a cell.  It can then suggest links (representing actionable possibilities) ranked according to strength determined by configurable heuristics.

A general-purpose semantic network represents the simulation state of our quantifiable, describable, and measurable experience.  It discovers possible experiences to function as a tool for analyzing and optimizing certain qualities of existence.  Historical datasets bounded by a spacetime window can be reviewed and analyzed in the same user-interface as ongoing activities or future projections.

A semantic concept representing each agent (ex: a human or animal) can participate in interaction processes that constitute awareness of and potential to operate upon subsets of simulation content. Choice and configuration of one's 'interaction methods can be customized according to a particular situation or adjusted to compensate for a user's sensory, kinesthetic, or cognitive disabilities. 

A network consists of a community-managed P2P decentralized web network to which clients may connect. Servers could communicate with other servers in various P2P networks such as Telehash, Kademlia, Gnutella, BitTorrent, Yacy, GnuNET, etc...
