----

# Object
A **netention object**, or simply "**nobject**",  semantically expresses a discrete unit of thought and all its related quantifiable and qualifiable characteristics, along with metadata describing provenance information.  

They are canonically serializable as **JSON** objects which is a compact representation readily manipulated by Javascript, most programming languages (via libraries), and certain NoSQL databases.
 * **id** - URI of this object; typically a randomly generated UUID
 * **name** - string representing a title or subject-line
 * **author** - ID of the author
 * **subject** - ID of who or what the object describes
 * **createdAt** - unix time this object was created
 * **modifiedAt** - unix time this object was last modified.  if not present, assumed to be the same as createdAt
 * **focus** - indicates if object is a focus change
 * **expiresAt** - unix time by which this object should be automatically removed
 * **removed** - indicates that any instances of an object with this ID should be deleted (used for broadcasting deletion)
 * **hidden** - indicates the object should not ordinarily be displayed in lists and feeds
 * **scope** - integer indicating the sharing/privacy level (see ObjScope constants in util.js)
 * **value** - array of value entries (for preserving their order)
   * **id** - URI of the tag this represents, or the property this provides a value for
   * **value** - object representing the data value (not used if id refers to a tag)
   * **strength** - value from 0 to 100% (0.0 to 1.0) indicating the relative strength or weight of this value in relation to other values in this object
 * **in** - embedded object indexed by ID's of objects forming directed edge **to**; the value is the edge's associated value (can be numeric, representing its strength or an object)
 * **out** - embedded object indexed by ID's of objects forming directed edge **from**
 * **with** - embedded object indexed by ID's of objects forming undirected edge **with**

----

# Focus
A **focus** describes what one is thinking about or interested in.  It functions as a semantic analog-to-digital converter for expressing oneâ€™s mental state in a machine-readable data structure.  A focus may be used to compare relevancy with known data objects in order to filter and data, or to create a new (prototype) data object (which may be stored for future use and/or shared with others).

It is expressed as a nobject with optional extra metadata.  Its values represent a proportional-strength tag vector.  Other metadata fields indicate filtering and sorting modes.  

The server can then aggregate all user focus objects, as they change, and analyze their attention dynamics.

 * **Keywords** (provided by the name field)
 * **Tags**
 * **Who** - selects by author
 * _TODO:_ **Where** - geolocation
 * _TODO:_ **When** - time range
 * **userRelation.itrust** - objects by those that I "trust"
 * **userRelation.trustme** - objects by those that "trust" me
 * ...

**See**: client/search.js

# Widgets
Widgets are dynamically generated HTML5 user-interface components that are utilized repeatedly by views and other widgets.

## Avatar Menu
Provides access to views, identity manipulation, display of the current focus, common actions (such as creating a new object), and additional controls specific to, and added by the current view.  It can be minimized and maximized by clicking the avatar square (displaying the current user's avatar icon).

# Views
A View is a particular mode of interacting with the client user-interface.  One view is active at any time (support for views containing multiple embedded views will be eventually possible).  Changes to the client's identity, focus, or memory can trigger a view to refresh, unless the **view lock** (_TODO_) is active.

# Actions
Actions are client-side operations that may be invoked on a set of zero or more selected objects.  Their relevance is determined contextually; certain operations pertain to certain kinds and amounts of objects.  Changing the selection set updates the set of possible actions.

__See:__ client/actions.js

----
# Server Plugins
Server plugins provide server-side functionality, such as:
 * Enhancing the ontology with extra tags and properties
 * Importing or generating data from remote systems
 * Exporting data to remote systems
 * Modifying data
 * Triggering actions

Each plugin can be activated and deactivated during run-time, with a list of plugins to automatically activate on startup specified in options.js.  A plugin exposes a standard interface that provides it with access to server functionality and allows the server to call the event handlers it defines.

----

# Connections
_TODO:_ Connections provide information and actions about how the client and/or server interface with remote systems.

In **Local** mode, they provide ways for the offline client to connect to remote systems.

----

# Server Configuration
The server configuration (**options.js**) specifies all information necessary for the server to start.  It also includes the client configuration which is served to the client.

See **options.js.EXAMPLE** for notes about each configuration option.

----

# Client Configuration
In **WebSocket** mode, the client configuration is provided by the client section of the server's configuration in **options.js**

In **Local** mode, the client configuration is provided by **client/client_configuration.js**

----
# Utility API
A set of functions shared by both the client and server systems.  Includes functions for inspecting and manipulating nobjects.

See: **client/util.h**

----

# Client API
The **$N** global object provides an interface to all client functionality:
 * Connection and Disconnection
 * Publishing, updating, deleting, and retrieving objects
 * Becoming Selves
 * Accessing and changing configuration data
 * ...


----

# Server API
The server object, referenced by **$N** (separate and different from the client's $N) provides an interface to all server functionality:
 * Publishing, updating, deleting, and retrieving objects
 * Adding URL handlers
 * Accessing and changing configuration data
 * ...

# Server HTTP API

# Server WebSockets API
